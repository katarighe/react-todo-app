<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 To Do Application <a name="about-project"></a>

This is a **simple To Do app** built with React and Vite. It allows users to add, remove, and mark as completed To Do items. The app is fully functional and can be used to manage your daily tasks.

The app is built using React components, which makes it easy to maintain and extend. The code is well-organized and commented, making it easy to understand. The app is also responsive and works well on all screen sizes.

To use the app, simply add a new To Do item by entering the text in the input box and clicking the "Add Todo" button. To remove a To Do item, click the "Remove" button next to the item. To mark a To Do item as completed, click the checkbox next to the item.

The app is open source and available on GitHub. Feel free to fork the project and make your own changes.
